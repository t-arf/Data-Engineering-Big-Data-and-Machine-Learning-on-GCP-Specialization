In your lab, you will be using prebuilt ML models to classify and label images.
You will practice finding the limits of the labels available in Cloud Vision API,
and then extend the model with your own images using Auto ML.
Keep in mind you have multiple attempts to take the lab, so you can experiment with 
different approaches or even experiment with other datasets as well.

Classify Images with Pre-built ML Models using Cloud Vision API and AutoML
In this lab, you will experiment with pre-built models so there's no coding. First we'll start with the pre-trained Vision API where we don't need to bring our own data and then we'll progress into AutoML for more sophisticated custom labelling that we need.

What you learn
In this lab, you learn how to:

Setup API key for ML Vision API
Invoke the pretrained ML Vision API to classify images
Review label predictions from Vision API
Train and evaluate custom AutoML Vision image classification model
Predict with AutoML on new image
